*Onyx Task Bundle for Implementing Data Processing Tasks in R*


## Rationale

onyx-r provides an Onyx [task
bundle](http://www.onyxplatform.org/jekyll/update/2016/06/13/Task-Bundles.html)
for running data processing tasks in [R](https://www.r-project.org).

A typical use case is running R models (created via statistical or machine
learning algorithms) in Onyx job workflows, at scale:

1. A [data scientist](https://xkcd.com/552/) exports a model as an RData file
   `model.RData`.
2. An Onyx developer configures an onyx-r task to load the model on job submit
   time and use it to create predictions when bundles of Onyx segments arrive
   at the task. 


## Architecture Overview

Each Onyx peer runs an Rserve instance, each virtual peer holds a connection to
its local Rserve instance. onyx-r tasks are configured at job submit time
through pure Clojure data in the Onyx catalog. onyx-r tasks are implemented as
pure R functions that take an Onyx segment as input and return a modified Onyx
segment as output. For this to work seamlessly, onyx-r automatically translates
between Clojure and R data structures. onyx-r tasks must be configured with the
name of the R segment processing function to call.

When an onyx-r task is prepared for execution on a virtual peer through [Onyx
lifecycles](http://www.onyxplatform.org/docs/user-guide/0.9.10-beta1/#lifecycles),
the task can be provided with R code to `source`, R data (in `RData` format
exported from R via `save`) to `load` and Clojure values to assign to R
variables to `assign`. These configuration options are also supplied by the
user at job submit time through the Onyx catalog.


## Quick Start Guide

First, install Rserve on each Onyx peer as described at:
https://www.rforge.net/Rserve/doc.html

### Running the Tests

Start a local Rserve server as documented at:
https://www.rforge.net/Rserve/doc.html#start

Then type `lein test` to runn all tests for onyx-r.

### onyx-r Task Options

The following Clojure code block shows how to configure an onyr-r task through
`add-task`:

```clojure
(add-task
  my-base-job
  (onyx-r.tasks.r/r-function
    :rfun ; name of the Onyx task 
    "rfun" ; name of the R function to call
    {:source ["rfun <- function(segment) list(segment = segment, assigned = c(bar, baz), loaded = testData)"] ; R code to source when the task is prepared for execution on a virtual peer
     :load [(slurp-bytes "testData.RData")] ; RData to load when the task is prepared for execution on a virtual peer
     :assign {:bar 42
              :baz "Hallo, Onyx!"}} ; R variables to assign when the task is prepared for execution on a virtual peer 
    batch-settings))
```

Use something like `slurp-bytes` to load RData files into a Byte arrays
expected by onyx-r's `:load` parameter:

```clojure
(defn slurp-bytes
  "Slurp the bytes from a slurpable thing"
  [x]
  (with-open [out (java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream.)]
    (clojure.java.io/copy (clojure.java.io/input-stream x) out)
    (.toByteArray out)))
```
